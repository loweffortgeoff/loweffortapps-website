                                <h2>Get to Know Low Effort Apps</h2>

                                <p>I build simple, useful apps designed to cut through friction and make everyday life a little easier. My focus is on clarity, speed, and clean design — tools that feel good to use and stay out of the user's way.</p>
                              
                              <p>I'm an independent app developer building a growing collection of projects under the Low Effort Apps umbrella. Each app starts the same way: identify a real problem, strip it down to its essentials, and build something fast, reliable, and thoughtfully designed.</p>
                              
                              <p>I'm not chasing trends or trying to reinvent the wheel. I care about fit, flow, and practical impact. If a feature doesn't make an app better to use, it doesn't ship. If something can be simpler, it gets simpler.</p>
                              
                              <p>My work leans on SwiftUI, a sharp design eye, and a bias toward fast iteration. I like tools that feel handcrafted, consistent, and approachable — whether it's a task manager, a daily countdown app, or a small utility that solves a very specific annoyance.</p>
                              
                              <p>Low Effort Apps is about creating software that respects people's time. No fluff, no clutter, no friction — just well-made apps that help you move through your day a little smoother.</p>
                              
                              <p>If you want to follow along, I write about tech, design, and app building over on Substack. But just like choosing one of my apps, that part's entirely up to you.</p>
